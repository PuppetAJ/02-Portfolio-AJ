# Portfolio Challenge

## Contents
This is Adrian Jimenez's portfolio challenge submission. 

To complete this project I initially wireframed the site as I thought it would be structured based on the mockup. Then I began making a rough outline of all the main elements, using elements with little to no style to design a rough layout of how the page should look. Afterwards, I spent alot of time working to optimize both the CSS and HTML code, minimizing on repititions, and properly positioning elements as I saw fit. After much tweaking, I then added media queries to the stylesheet to allow the webpage to become fully responsive. After some finishing touches I was finally complete with the site, which I can later restructure and edit when I learn more.

Once I completed this task I deployed the project onto GitHub Pages.
